#### About Me

I am currently a master's student in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Xiamen University, where I also completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Technology in 2024. 
I am currently affiliated with the **[ASC laboratory](https://asc.xmu.edu.cn/t/xiongkezheng)** of Xiamen University, where I engage in cutting-edge research and participate in various projects that enhance my skills in artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision. 

Currently, my research interests lie in the field of 3D computer vision. Particularly, I am working on **point cloud registration**, which is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Starting from 2023, I have contributed to the field through research that constitutes important research projects of the laboratory that I am affiliated with. My researches have been published in top-tier AI conferences, such as AAAI and NeurIPS.

#### News

- **[09/2024]**: One [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01870) on unsupervised point cloud registration has been accepted to NeurIPS 2024.
- **[12/2023]**: One [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08664) on cross-source point cloud registration has been accepted to AAAI 2024.
